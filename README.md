# JavaClassWeek1
This repo was set up primarily to test a GitHub connection with NetBeans.

Just the last file of week one in Java. Simple program with a complete user input being taken in as a string, parsed to the relevant data
type and manipulated.  Program alerts user if the input is invalid and asks again. Program is terminated when the user inputs a "q" or "Q"
or when the correct information is displayed.
